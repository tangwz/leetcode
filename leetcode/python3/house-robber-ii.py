#
# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
# house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
# arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last
# one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected andÂ it will
# automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on
# the same night.
# 
# Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of
# each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without
# alerting the police.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,3,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money =
# 2),
# because they are adjacent houses.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money =
# 3).
# Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
#

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp = [[-1 for i in nums] for x in range(2)]
        def f(idx, start):
            if idx < start:
                return 0
            if dp[start][idx] != -1:
                return dp[start][idx]
            ans = max(f(idx-2, start) + nums[idx], f(idx-1, start))
            dp[start][idx] = ans
            return ans
        return max(f(len(nums)-1, 1), f(len(nums)-2, 0))
